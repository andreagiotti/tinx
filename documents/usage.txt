-- Command syntax --

tinx [-cdfilqv] [-I {state}] [-L {log}] [-t time] [{base}]
tinx -h
tinx_mt [-cdDfilqv] [-I {state}] [-L {log}] [-n processes] [-t time] [{base}]
tinx_mt -h

{base}: Specify knowledge base file name as {base} + ".tin". If no name is given, it defaults to "default.tin".
-c: Use causal inference only (from past to future).
-d: Display status (">" = processing, "*" = idle for closure, "|" = idle for buffer) and last event processed.
-D: Display debug informations (in V3.3mt and later).
-f: Enable file-based input and output, disable IPC.
-h: Print usage.
-i: Load an initial state file. If no file name is given by -I option, it defaults to {base} + "_ic.evl".
-I {state}: Load an initial state file named {state} + ".evl".
-l: Log processed events in a file. If no file name is given by -L option, it defaults to {base} + "_log.evl".
-L {log}: Log processed events in a file named {log} + ".evl".
-n {processes}: Specify number of threads for parallel processing (defaults to 7 in V3.3mt and later).
-q: Disable input and output, both IPC and file-based I/O.
-t {step}: Specify approximated sampling period in seconds as float {step} (defaults to 0.1 in V2.0 and later).
-v: Verify soundness at runtime.

The execution can be safely interrupted with a single SIGINT (^C) or by sending an Escape char (\x1b) through some input channel.

tint [-q] [-t {step}] [{base}]
tint -h

{base}: Specify knowledge base file name as {base} + ".tin". If no name is given, it defaults to "default.tin".
-h: Print usage.
-q: Don't trace signals.
-t {step}: Specify approximated sampling period in seconds as float {step} (defaults to 0.05 in V0.5, to 0.1 in V0.6 and later).
