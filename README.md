# tinx
A real time inference engine for temporal logic specifications, which is able to process and generate any binary signal through POSIX IPC or files.
Specifications of signals are represented as special graphs and executed in real time, with a sampling time of few milliseconds.
The accepted language provides timed logic operators, conditional operators, interval operators, bounded quantifiers and parametrization of signals.
